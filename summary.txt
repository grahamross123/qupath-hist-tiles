- Using the predictions in the folder /camp/stp/ddt/working/DeepHiPa/resources/models_pbrm1_bap1_no_whole_patient/omero_shufflenet_v2_x1_0_lr0.1_mag20_patch512x512_1/epoch_50_1634986138
- For every slide, only the positive predicted tiles are selected with a confidence > 0.99 for both BAP1 and PBRM1.
- Limited to 100 total tiles per slide
 	- If there are over 100 tiles in a slide, the highest confidence tiles are chosen
 	- If multiple tiles have the same confidence they are picked randomly
- The scripts are located in https://github.com/grahamross123/qupath-hist-tiles
- The number of BAP1 vs PBRM1 tiles and the total distribution over all the slides are shown below:

Total number of tiles:	5511
Number of BAP1 tiles:	1353
Number of PBRM1 tiles:	4158

Percentage of total tiles in each slide:
