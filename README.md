# QuPath Histology Tiles

This repo contains the scripts to search through the output TSV files from the DeepHiPa pipeline and create annotation geojson files containing the highest confidence tiles.
It also includes a script to convert a TSV prediction file into a heatmap which can be imported into QuPath.
